# Wordle game - vanilla Javascript
This project is about recreating the guessing game Wordle and covers the core game logic but  
does not implement sharing your results and doesn't cover the functionality that generates  
game statistics. This project is intended for beginners front-end developers that want to  
build a fun, vanilla Javascript project. The building of this project only requires  
understanding og HTML, CSS, Javascript and NPM.

I'm going to be using a JavaScript library called Toastr for in-game notifications and a CSS  
library called Animate.css for the board animations.
